Oh my, this is taking some careful thinking about! A design system is not a
simple thing!

## How theming works

Ex Libris hosts collections of content for a variety of different games.
Creating a design system that allows for a decent degree of theming to support
the individual styles of these games felt important.

The key to all this is CSS variables...

All styling is applied with [Tailwind] classes:

```html
<span class="tw-bg-main-3 tw-px-4 tw-py-2 tw-rounded-lg">Hello!</span>
```

[Tailwind] is configured to provide CSS variables instead of values:

```css
.tw-bg-main-3 {
  background-color: var(--color--main-3);
}

.tw-px-4 {
  padding-left: var(--spacing--4);
  padding-right: var(--spacing--4);
}

.tw-py-2 {
  padding-bottom: var(--spacing--2);
  padding-top: var(--spacing--2);
}

.tw-rounded-lg {
  border-radius: var(--radius--lg);
}
```

Then each theme can provide its own definitions of those variables:

```
:root {
  --color--main-3: purple;

  --spacing--2: 2px
  --spacing--4: 4px;

  --radius--lg: 8px;
}
```

### Further steps on theming

Right now, the style tokens (CSS classes generated by [Tailwind]) are all
defined based on the original Tailwind configuration values. This makes theming
complicated as `.tw-p-4` might be used to provide padding in multiple different
components. Changing the definition of `.tw-p-4` would affect each of those
components.

Instead, it would be helpful to extract individual tokens like `.tw-p-button`
which applies all the padding we want to use for an individual button.

Better yet, it might help to define a single `.tw-button` class and use the
[`@apply`
directive](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles#extracting-classes-with-apply)
to apply the styling in separate CSS files.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer components {
  /* Tailwind is configured to apply a tw- prefix */
  .button {
    @apply p-4;
  }
}
```

The exact approach isn't clear yet. But it will be easier to decide when a
reasonable amount of a standard system theme is complete.
